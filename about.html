    <h3>Front-end developer from Chicago, USA</h3>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <p>
        I am a recent graduate of a coding bootcamp, having earned my Junior
        Front-End Developer Certification, and I am eager to propel my career in
        that direction. Throughout the program, I honed a diverse set of skills,
        mastering fundamental concepts like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while
        delving into more advanced topics such as AI integration, Responsive
        Design, React, Bootstrap, API utilization, and SEO optimization.
        Proficient in tools like VS Code, I've also gained experience in hosting
        websites and ensuring their visibility through effective SEO strategies.
        With a strong foundation and a passion for innovation, I'm excited to
        embark on this journey and contribute positively to the dynamic world of
        front-end development.
